    <p class="lead">
      Here you can add some information about you. A small excerpt that describes 
      your experience, for example.   
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
      You explain something about your academic/study background, as well as your
      preferred areas of work. Think of this area as context-setting for the experience
      that you will describe below. Why did you change jobs? What drove you to take a 
      new gig? Even if you are not looking for a job, it's a good way to hint about
      what kind of projects you are interested in.
